    "This document contains a collection of SQL queries designed to analyze coffee sales data. These queries provide insights into revenue trends, sales distribution by payment type, product popularity, and time-based sales trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table Used: `[Coffee sales]`\n",
    "### Key Columns:\n",
    "- `datetime` - Timestamp of the sale (Unique)\n",
    "- `date` - Date of the sale\n",
    "- `money` - Sale amount\n",
    "- `cash_type` - Payment method (Card/Cash)\n",
    "- `coffee_name` - Product sold\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Queries Included\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Integrity Check\n",
    "- **Ensure `datetime` column is unique:**\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  ALTER TABLE [Coffee sales] ADD CONSTRAINT unique_datetime UNIQUE (datetime);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Find duplicate `datetime` entries:**\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT datetime, COUNT(datetime) AS value_count\n",
    "  FROM [Coffee sales]\n",
    "  GROUP BY datetime\n",
    "  HAVING COUNT(datetime) > 1;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Revenue Analysis\n",

    "  ORDER BY DATEPART(hour, datetime);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "- Ensure your database has a `Coffee sales` table with the necessary columns.\n",
    "- Run the queries in an SQL environment (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL).\n",
    "- Modify date filters as needed to analyze different time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- The `datetime` column is set as `UNIQUE` to prevent duplicate entries.\n",
    "- Date formatting uses `FORMAT()` and `DATENAME()` for better readability.\n",
    "- Ensure your database supports functions like `DATEPART()`, `DATENAME()`, and `FORMAT()`.\n",
